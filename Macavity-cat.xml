			<head> MACAVITY: THE MYSTERY CAT </head>
			<byline>
				<docAuthor>T.S. Eliot</docAuthor>
			</byline>
			<lg><l> Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw </l><l>For he's the master criminal
				who can defy the Law. </l><l>He's the bafflement of <orgName key="Scotland Yard" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/9301149198352074940001/">Scotland Yard</orgName>, the <orgName key="Great Britain. Metropolitan Police Service. Flying Squad" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/128092964/">Flying Squad</orgName>'s
				despair: </l><l>For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there! </l></lg><lg>
			<l> Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, </l><l>He's broken every human law, he
				breaks the law of gravity. </l><l>His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare, </l><l>And
				when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there! </l><l>You may seek him in the
				basement, you may look up in the air— </l><l>But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's
				not there! </l></lg><lg>
			<l> Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin; </l><l>You would know him if you saw
				him, for his eyes are sunken in. </l><l>His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is
				highly domed; </l><l>His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed. </l><l>He sways
				his head from side to side, with movements like a snake; </l><l>And when you think he's
				half asleep, he's always wide awake. </l></lg>

			<pb n="2" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djakacki/leaf_workshops/main/PracticeMaterials/Section1_ExerciseFiles/Macavity2.jpg"/>
			<ab> Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, For he's a fiend in feline shape,
				a monster of depravity. You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the
				square-- But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there! </ab>

			<ab> He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.) And his footprints are
				not found in any file of Scotland Yard's. And when the larder's looted, or the
				jewel-case is rifled, Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,
				Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair- Ay, there's the
				wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there! </ab>
			<ab> And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty's gone astray, Or the Admiralty lose some
				plans and drawings by the way, There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the
				stair- But it's useless to investigate—Macavity's not there! And when the loss has
				been disclosed, the Secret Service say: "It must have been Macavityl"—but he's a
				mile away. You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs, Or
				engaged in doing complicated long division sums. </ab>
			<ab> Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a Cat of such
				deceitfulness and suavity. </ab>
			<pb n="3" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djakacki/leaf_workshops/main/PracticeMaterials/Section1_ExerciseFiles/Macavity3.jpg"/> 
			
			<ab>He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare: At whatever time the deed took
				place-MACAVITY WASN'T / THERE! And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are
				widely known (I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone) Are nothing
				more than agents for the Cat who all the time Just controls their operations: the
				Napoleon of Crimel </ab>
